Human Dynamics Estimation (HDE) is a collection of YARP devices for the online estimation of the kinematics and dynamics of a human subject monitored with a set of wearable sensors and/or interacting with a robot. A ROS-based visualizer allows to visualize in real-time the output of the estimation. The devices can be installed and run in Linux, MacOS and Windows.

## Overview
The main devices contained in this project are the following:
- **HumanStateProvider**: solve inverse kinematics given a set of kinematic sensor.
- **HumanDynamicsEstimator**: solve the inverse dynamics given the kinematic state and a set of wrenches measurment.
- **RobotPositionControl**: controls the position of a robot with a given kinematic state.

The information coming from the sensors come in the form of the `IWear` [YARP interface](https://www.yarp.it/group__dev__iface.html), for more reference on how those are generated please refer to [`Wearables`](https://github.com/robotology/wearables). All the information exchanged among the HDE devices trough implmented in this project (`IHumanDynamics`, `IHumanState`, `IHumanWrench`) and can be published among a network using the coreresponding wrapper devices

A possible architecture integrating wearable sensors and HDE is described in the following scheme:

## Dependencies
Here following there is a list of dependencies you need for using this repository.  It is worth to notice that the *build* ones and the *libraries* are mandatory to install your project. Instead, the *optional dependencies* are defined optional in the sense that the project is built even if they are not included.  The installation of the all dependencies  is strongly suggested if you want to have a visual feedback of how much your estimation is good.

For installing the dependencies you can decide to install them individually or to use the [robotology-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild) with the `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS` option that automatically is in charge of installing all the dependencies you need (except for the optional ones).  Keep in mind that the `robotology-superbuild` is surely the fastest way to install them but it contains many more things than you need!

#### Build dependencies
- [**CMake**](https://cmake.org/download/): an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
- [**YCM**](http://robotology.github.io/ycm/gh-pages/master/manual/ycm-installing.7.html): a CMake project whose only goal is to download and build several other projects.

#### Libraries
- [**YARP**](https://github.com/robotology/yarp): a library and toolkit for communication and device interfaces.
- [**icub-main**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main): a library for the interaction with the iCub robot.
- [**iDynTree**](https://github.com/robotology/idyntree): a library of robots dynamics algorithms for control, estimation and simulation.
- [**Wearables**](https://github.com/robotology/wearables): a library for communication and interfaces with wearable sensors.
- [**Eigen**](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (3.3 or later): a C++ template library for linear algebra.
- [**IPOPT**](http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Installing_IPOPT): a software package for large-scale nonlinear optimization.

#### Optional dependencies
- [**ROS**](http://wiki.ros.org) with [**rviz**](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) package: an open-source provider of libraries and tools for creating robot applications.

## How to install
After installing all the dependencies, you can install the HDE project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/robotology-playground/human-dynamics-estimation.git
mkdir build
cd build
```

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/installation/folder -G "name-of-your-cmake-generator" ..
```
where the `name-of-your-cmake-generator` is your project generator, see [Cmake-Generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html). For example, on macOS you may choose `Xcode`, or on Unix `Unix Makefiles`.

Then, for compiling
```
cmake --build . --config Release
```
and installing
```
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

## Applications
The code contained in this repository can serve different application. Depending on the type of application, a different set of hardware and sensors are required. In addiction, since the applications are based on [wearables devices](https://github.com/robotology/wearables), a certain number of wearable devices should be running providing the source sensor data.
The main applications are the following

| Application | hardware | werable device | 
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:| 
| Inverse Kinematics | kinematic sensors | XsensSuit |
| Dynamics Estimation | kinematic sensors <br> FTshoes | XsensSuit <br> FTshoes |
| Human-Robot Interaction | kinematic sensors <br> FTsensors <br> FTshoes | XsensSuit <br> FTshoes <br> robot |
| Whole-Body Retargeting | kinematic sensors <br> robot | XsensSuit |

## How to run
### Applications
Documentation for running each specific application can be found at the following links:
- Inverse Kinematics
- Dynamics Estimation
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Whole-Body Retargeting

Accordingly to what presented in [previous section](https://github.com/robotology/human-dynamics-estimation#applications), each application will require a proper set of wearable device sources running.

### Wearable device sources
Documentation for running the wearable data source can be found in [`wearables`](https://github.com/robotology/wearables) at the following links:
- [FTShoes](https://github.com/robotology/wearables/blob/master/doc/How-to-run-FTshoes.md)
- [XsensSuit](https://github.com/robotology/wearables/blob/master/doc/How-to-run-XsensSuit.md)
